My solutions for Advent of code 2023

Will this finally be the year I have the time and willpower to solve them all?

Rules:
- ~~clean but not complicated code, no need for fancy stuff~~ 
- ~~each part solution is standalone, ignoring common code~~

Already broken these in day 2, new rule: wing it!
